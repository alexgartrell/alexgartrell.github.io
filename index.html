          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
	    My name is Alex Gartrell and I'm a Software Engineer at
	    Facebook.  I recently (early May 2014) joined the Kernel team
	    where I work on the various networking things that we need.
	    Previously I worked on the CDN and Cache teams, working on
	    things ranging from
	    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/mcdipper-a-key-value-cache-for-flash-storage/10151347090423920">flash-based
	    caches</a>, encryption of cross datacenter cache traffic, and
	    the layer 7 protocol used for various caches.
          </p>
          <p>
            I graduated with a major in Computer Science and minor in
            Software Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University in
            Pittsburgh, PA.  While there, I TAed 15-213 Introduction to
            Computer Systems and 15-313 Fundamentals of Software
            Engineering.  I did a senior thesis where I wrote a linux
            kernel extension for thrift message routing.

          <h4><a href="http://www.mongrel2.org/">Mongrel2</a></h4>
          <p>
            In the past I contributed to Mongrel2.  I worked on static file
            serving (default files, metadata caching, etc.)  and I added
            SSL support using an embeddable SSL
            library, <a href="http://polarssl.org/">PolarSSL</a>.  I
            believe I still have commit access, but do not consider myself
            (and should not be considered by you to be) an active
            contributer.

          <h4><a href="http://www.chromium.org/">Chromium</a></h4>
          <p>
            While in school I took a Software Engineering class where we
            were to work on a large project.  My groupmate and I chose to
            work on Chromium.  I landed a couple patches involving
            Chromium's sync functionality, but nothing major.
